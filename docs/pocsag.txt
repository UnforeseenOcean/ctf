It's very easy to decode POCSAG transmissions with gqrx and multimon-ng. One thing you have to remember is that multimon expects input sampled at 22050Hz, so you may have to resample the output from gqrx.
The following flow worked well for me on linux:

#!/bin/bash
nc -4 -v --udp --listen localhost 65530|sox -b 16 -c 1 -e signed-integer -r 48000 -t raw - -r 22050 -t raw  -| multimon-ng -t raw -a POCSAG512 -a POCSAG1200 -a POCSAG2400 -f alpha  -- -

Once you've found a POCSAG channel, you can then plug your RTL dongle back into the Pi and use the following command to send output to the headphone jack. In the following example I'm tuning to 153.350MHz. This also has the side benefit of turning your RPi into an FM radio :-)
CODE: SELECT ALL
rtl_fm -f 153.350M | aplay -r 24k -f S16_LE -t raw -c 1


and finally to decode them using multimon-ng and output to stdin, you can use
CODE: SELECT ALL
rtl_fm -N -o 4 -A lut -s 22050 -C -f 153.350M - | multimon-ng -t raw -a POCSAG512 -a POCSAG1200 -a POCSAG2400 -f alpha /dev/stdin


If everything is working, you should see output like this:
POCSAG2400-: Alpha: 23:09-92 24/05/2013 14:33:05 AR02EH_2 High Alarm 70 AR02 AHU-20 Ext Air Humidity out of Limits Alarm Item Description Ext Air RH Details Status : Ext Air RH<NUL>


I think this is because of the centre spike in the E4000.  It is 
designed to tune to a slightly different frequency and then decode the 
broadcast off-centre, so any centre spike doesn't interfere with the signal. 

If you want to hear the audio while decoding, you can use multiple pipes 
(only tested in Bash) similar to this: 

$ rtl_fm -l 0 -f 148637000 -s 22050 - | tee >(./multimonNG -a POCSAG512 
-a POCSAG1200 -f alpha -t raw /dev/stdin) >(play -t raw -r 22050 -e 
signed-integer -b 16 -c1 -V1 -q -) > /dev/null 

There is a slight delay for me, but I still hear the audio as the 
message is being printed on the screen. 

Note that I have added the -l option in the command above which reduces 
the squelch level.  This is needed to receive signals considered too 
weak by the default value (-l 150).
