besside-ng

Besside-ng is a tool like Wesside-ng but it support also WPA encryption. Wich will crack
automatically all the WEP networks in range and log the WPA handshakes. WPA handshakes
captured can be uploaded to the online cracking service at Darkircop.org (Besside-ng
Companion) to attempt to get the password and where provides useful statistics based on
user-submitted capture files about the feasibility of WPA cracking.

Usage:

besside-ng [options] <interface>

Option	Param.	Description
-b	target mac	Specifies the target's BSSID
-s	WPA server	Where to upload capture file for cracking
-c	chan	Channel lock
-p	pps	Packages per second to send (flood rate)
-W	Crack only WPA networks
-v	Verbos mode, -vv for even more and so on
-h	Help screen

Easside-ng

Easside-ng is an auto-magic tool which allows you to communicate via an WEP-encrypted access
point (AP) without knowing the WEP key. It first identifies a network, then proceeds to
associate with it, obtain PRGA (pseudo random generation algorithm) xor data, determine the
network IP scheme and then setup a TAP interface so that you can communicate with the AP
without requiring the WEP key. All this is done without your intervention.

Usage

Usage: easside-ng <args>

Where:

-h Displays the list of options.
-v MAC address of the Access Point (Optional)
-m Source MAC address to be used (Optional)
-i Source IP address to be used on the wireless LAN. Defaults to the decoded network plus
”.123” (Optional)
-r IP address of the AP router. This could be the WAN IP of the AP or an actual router IP
depending on the topology. Defaults to the decoded network plus ”.1”. (Optional)
-s IP address of the “buddy” server (Mandatory)
-f Wireless interface name. (Mandatory)
-c Locks the card to the specified channel (Optional)

Wesside-ng

Wesside-ng is an auto-magic tool which incorporates a number of techniques to seamlessly
obtain a WEP key in minutes. It first identifies a network, then proceeds to associate with
it, obtain PRGA (pseudo random generation algorithm) xor data, determine the network IP
scheme, reinject ARP requests and finally determine the WEP key. All this is done without
your intervention.

Usage

Usage: wesside-ng <opts> -i <wireless interface name>

-h Displays the list of options.
-i Wireless interface name. (Mandatory)
-n Network IP as in “who has destination IP (netip) tell source IP (myip)”. Defaults to the
source IP on the ARP request which is captured and decrypted. (Optional)
-m MY IP “who has destination IP (netip) tell source IP (myip)”. Defaults to the network.123
on the ARP request captured(Optional)
-a Source MAC address (Optional)
-c Do not start aircrack-ng. Simply capture the packets until control-C is hit to stop the
program! (Optional)
-f Allows the highest channel for scanning to be defined. Defaults to channel 11. (Optional)
-k Ignores ACKs since some cards/drivers do not report them. It will therefore automatically
retransmit X times. That is, -k 1 will transmit once and assume the packet gets there. -k 2
will retransmit twice, and so on. Note: The higher the -k value, the slower transmission
rate will be due to the many retransmits. (Optional)
-p Determines the minimum number of bytes of PRGA which are gathered. Defaults to 128 bytes.
(Optional)
-t For each number of IVs specified, restart the airecrack-ng PTW engine. (Optional)
-v Wireless access point MAC address (Optional)
When you run wesside-ng, it creates three files automatically in the current directory:

wep.cap - The packet capture file. It contains the full packet, not just the IVs.
prga.log - Contains the PRGA obtained through the fragmentation attack. The following is NOT
correct. It is a future feature: “This can be used as input to other aircrack-ng suite tools
which require PRGA as input. You can also use the PRGA from other tools for this file.”
key.log - Contains the WEP key when it is found.

wesside-ng -i wlan0
